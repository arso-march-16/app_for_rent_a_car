--How to Run This Flutter App in Google Chrome Using Android Studio--

1. Open the project

Launch Android Studio.

Click on "Open" and select the root folder of your Flutter project.

2. Ensure Flutter web support is enabled

Open the terminal (at the bottom of Android Studio) and run:

flutter doctor

Make sure it shows [✓] Chrome - develop for the web.

If it doesn’t, run:

flutter config --enable-web

3. Select Chrome as the target device

At the top of Android Studio, click the device selector dropdown (next to the green "Run" button).

Choose Chrome (web) from the list of devices. If Chrome is not listed, make sure it’s installed and try restarting Android Studio.

4. Run the app

Click the green Run button (▶), or use Shift + F10.

The application will compile and open automatically in a new Chrome tab. You can now test your Flutter web app directly in the browser.
